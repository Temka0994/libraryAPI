# How to use it
### Clone repository
Firstly, the project should be cloned using the following command in the console:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Temka0994/libraryAPI.git
```
After this navigate to the libraryAPI folder:
```bash
cd libraryAPI
```

### Requirements
Additionally, all the requirements should be downloaded using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database
The ready-made code for creating and populating the database from the [schema.sql](./src/schema.sql) file can be used, or a custom script may be created. The attached file contains queries for both table creation and data insertion. The database will appear as follows:

The next step is to change the database path. This should be done by opening the [database.py](./src/database.py) file and inserting the desired path into the `DATABASE_URL` field.

### Secret token
Of course, in order to take advantage of the JWT Token, you need to enter your key, which will be used to validate the token. You must enter it in the file [properties.py](./src/properties.py).

### Final step
After all this, you can run the application with the command:
```bash 
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
``` 

You can now go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` where you will see the documentation generated by OpenAPI. Here you can also use ready-made methods.
