# How to use it
Firstly, you need to clone the project. Do this using the following command in the console:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Temka0994/libraryAPI.git
```
After this navigate to the libraryAPI folder:
```bash

You can use the ready-made code for creating and filling the database from the [schema.sql](./src/schema.sql) file or create your own. The attached file has a query for both creating tables and filling them.
