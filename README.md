# How to use it
### Clone repository
Firstly, you need to clone the project. Do this using the following command in the console:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Temka0994/libraryAPI.git
```
After this navigate to the libraryAPI folder:
```bash
cd libraryAPI
```

### Requirements
Also, you need to download all the requirements. You can do this with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database
You can use the ready-made code for creating and filling the database from the [schema.sql](./src/schema.sql) file or create your own. The attached file has a query for both creating tables and filling them. Your database will look like the following:

The next step is to change the database path. Go to the [database.py](./src/database.py) file and put your path in the `DATABASE_URL` field.

### Secret token
Of course, in order to take advantage of the JWT Token, you need to enter your key, which will be used to validate the token. You must enter it in the file [properties.py](./src/properties.py).

### Final step
After all this, you can run the application with the command:
```bash 
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
``` 

You can now go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` where you will see the documentation generated by OpenAPI. Here you can also use ready-made methods.
